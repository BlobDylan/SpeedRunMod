# TerrariaSpeedrunVerificationMod

Features:

-by having the mod installed the user has a built in timer, when activated, a hash key will be set and displayed verifying the run. if the timer is stopped the key goes away, the key will also be somewhat transparent and change every once in a while making it harder to tamper with.

-the user will also have the option to turn the timer display off incase they want to use a third party timer.(not sure about this one...)

-additionally the user will be able to inspect their times at the end of their run in a similar fasion to boss checklist.

-this process will all be done on the client side only.
